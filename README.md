# 🐱 FiveCats - Movie Guessing Game

FiveCats is an interactive, multiplayer movie guessing game built with Flask and Flask-SocketIO. Players compete in real-time to identify movie posters from a selection of choices, earning points based on their accuracy and speed.

## 🎮 Game Overview

FiveCats is a fun, competitive game where players:

- Race against the clock to identify movies before time runs out

## 🎯 How to Play

### Setting Up a Game

1. **Add Players**: 
   - On the home page, enter player names and click "Ajouter" (Add)
   - Each player gets a unique QR code displayed in the table

2. **Configure Game Settings**:
   - **Number of choices per question**: Choose between 4-10 options (default: 10)
   - **Time per question**: Set timer from 10-360 seconds (default: 60)
   - **Total questions**: Set number of questions or 0 for all available (default: 0)

3. **Start the Game**:
   - Click the "Go" button to launch the game board in a new window

### Playing the Game

1. **For the Game Host**:
   - The game board displays the current movie poster
   - A countdown timer shows remaining time
   - Real-time leaderboard displays all players' scores
   - The game automatically advances to the next question

2. **For Players**:
   - Scan your personal QR code or click your name to open your player interface
   - View the current movie poster on your device
   - Select from the available movie title choices
   - See your current score and the question's point value
   - Submit your answer before time runs out!

### Scoring System

- Points are awarded using a Fibonacci sequence: **0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55**
- Your score depends on:
  - How many choices remain (fewer incorrect guesses = more points)
  - How quickly you answer relative to other players
- First correct answer gets maximum available points
- Wrong answers eliminate that choice but reduce potential points
- No points if time runs out

## 🎲 Game Mechanics

### Question Class
- Randomly selects a subset of movies for each question
- Tracks each player's remaining choices
- Calculates scores based on Fibonacci sequence
- Manages question state and timeout

### Player Class
- Stores player name and unique token
- Tracks cumulative score
- Generates personal QR code for mobile access

### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket events for:
  - Score updates
  - New question notifications
  - Timeout handling
  - Player connections

## ⚙️ Configuration

The game can be configured through the web interface or by modifying default values in `app.py`:

```python
choices = 10        # Number of choices per question (4-10)
Timer = 60          # Time per question in seconds (10-360)
total = 0           # Total questions (0 = all available)
```

## 🌐 Deployment

The application is designed to run on platforms like Render, Heroku, or any Python-compatible hosting service.

**Important**: Update the QR code URL in `player.py` to match your deployment URL:
```python
img = qrcode.make('https://your-domain.com/player/' + self.name, ...)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **QR codes not generating**: Ensure the `static/players/` directory exists and has write permissions
- **Movies not loading**: Verify movie poster images are in `static/movies/` as PNG files
- **WebSocket connection issues**: Check firewall settings and ensure port 5000 is accessible
- **Players can't connect**: Update the QR code URL in `player.py` to your actual domain
